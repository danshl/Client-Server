# Client-Server
Implementation of a server in the JAVA language and clients in the C++ language using the STOMPS protocol.

_____
Description: I had the privilege of working on a project that required the implementation of a server and clients using both Java and C++ languages. I applied my knowledge and expertise in both programming languages to develop a comprehensive and efficient system that allows for seamless communication between the clients and the server. This system is designed to create a channel that the clients can listen to and receive updates as needed. The final outcome of this project is a well-designed and robust system that can handle large amounts of data and provide reliable and fast communication. This project allowed me to improve my skills and deepen my understanding of the concepts of server-client communication, and how to use Java and C++ for this purpose.
